A core machine learning project
where I've analysed the data in a detailed manner

1.reading the data
2.preprocessing the data
3.visualizing date by plotting the graphs for attributes and dealing with outliers
4.building a model accordingly
5.training the model
6.deploying the model


Building a model that can predict the cancer mortality rates for US countries

Firstly install all the packages 
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit_learn
pip install statsmodels

plot graphs(histpgram/box plot, scatter plot etc ) for each attributes v/s death rate
and find the outliers, shape etc

use interactive mode and run selected lines of code to understand the ....

identigy the datatypes of the data in each columns and do prerpocessing accordingly

after procesing the data set 
now let's deal with outliers 
firstly by plotting graphs of required types to find the outliers
